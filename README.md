# Calculator

Yeah, just calculator. You shouldn't use this if you have other calculator. This calculator sucks.

## Installation

Clone this repo then you can access it directly, host a simple file-server with HTTP, use pywebview (you can use main.py), or you can use whatever to access that index.html file.

## History

Why did I even bother... Anyway, it was originated when my teacher started saying about some future tasks. I want to see how 'hard' is it when making a simple calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It took me around 4 hours to make.

Yeah no shit sherlock, this app is full of bugs. No wonder it took 4 hours. It's just a Proof-of-concept.
