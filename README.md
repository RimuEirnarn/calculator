# Calculator

Yeah, just a calculator. You shouldn't use this if you have another calculator. This calculator sucks.

## Installation

Clone this repo, and then you can access it directly, host a simple file server with HTTP, use Pywebview (you can use main.py), or you can use whatever to access that index.html file.

The only requirement is anything with CPU, Memory, display, web browser (or anything like webview), storage and internet connection (to clone this repo duh, not actually required if you already have it somewhere local and only need to copy it).

### Or... use this one:

## History

Why did I even bother... Anyway, it originated when my teacher started talking about some future tasks. I want to see how 'hard' is it when making a simple calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It took me around 4 hours to make.

> Does this app have any bugs?

Yeah no shit sherlock, this app is full of bugs. No wonder it took 4 hours. It's just a Proof-of-concept.
