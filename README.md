# Calculator

Yeah, just a calculator. You shouldn't use this if you have another calculator. This calculator sucks.

## Installation

Clone this repo, and then you can access it directly, host a simple file server with HTTP, use Pywebview (you can use main.py), or you can use whatever to access that index.html file.

### Or... use this one:

## History

Why did I even bother... Anyway, it originated when my teacher started talking about some future tasks. I want to see how 'hard' is it when making a simple calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It took me around 4 hours to make.

> Does this app have any bugs?

Yeah no shit sherlock, this app is full of bugs. No wonder it took 4 hours. It's just a Proof-of-concept.
